The final boundaries were released to the public in August 2004. As with the LSOAs, initial MSOAs were generated automatically by zone-design software. They were built using 2001 Census data from groups of Lower Layer SOAs and had a minimum size of 5,000 residents and 2,000 households. They also fitted within the boundaries of local authorities as at the end of 2002 (corresponding with the geography of the Census). A nationwide consultation exercise gave local authorities the opportunity to amend the initial MSOAs to define areas more suited to local requirements. The consultation resulted in 7,193 MSOAs with an average population size of 7,200."
